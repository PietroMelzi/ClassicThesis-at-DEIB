\chapter*{Abstract}
In reinforcement learning, policy optimization algorithms normally rely on action randomization to make the learning problem easier and to guarantee a sufficient exploration of all the possible situations in the task. Action randomization allows to execute and evaluate a wide range of actions that otherwise may be neglected by the algorithm. However, this practice may be unacceptable in real-life applications, such as industrial ones, where safety is a concern and deviations from usual behavior are not welcome by stakeholders. There exist multiple and not exclusive definitions of safety in reinforcement learning, hence safety aspects can be modeled and incorporated in the tasks in different ways. We consider the challenging scenario in which a learning agent is deployed in the real world and must be able to improve on-line without performing any random action, to ensure safe exploration throughout the learning process. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we propose a truly deterministic policy optimization algorithm for continuous domains. To design this algorithm, we require the validity of some assumptions on the regularity of the environment, which we deem easy to satisfy in the scenarios of interest. We also use state aggregation to build an abstract model of the environment and exploit passive exploration, necessary to ensure \hl{successful} policy optimization. The proposed approach is tested on simulated continuous control tasks, both in the case of learning from scratch and in the case of having some prior knowledge of the problem. The results obtained from the experiments are promising and encourage the future development of the techniques presented in this work.
